# Dynamic Template and Document Fragment

This repository contains a proposal for more a advanced templating DOM API. The
proposal itself is meant to advance an already ongoing discussion on the
subject that's happening [here](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2254).

A semi-formal API specification is in the `spec.ts` file. A partial polyfill
(designed to demonstrate the concept) is in the `polyfill.ts` file.

Should this proposal be accepted, and the discussion would move forward, a more
formal proposal should be created, along with a feature-full polyfill and a set
of tests for verifying potential implementations in browsers.
