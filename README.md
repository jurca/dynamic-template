# Dynamic Template and Document Fragment

This repository contains a proposal for a more advanced templating DOM API. The
proposal itself is meant to advance an already ongoing discussion on the
subject that's happening [here](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2254).

A semi-formal API specification is in the `spec.ts` file. A partial polyfill
(designed to demonstrate the concept) is in the `polyfill.ts` file.

Should this proposal be accepted, and the discussion would move forward, a more
formal proposal should be created, along with a feature-full polyfill and a set
of tests for verifying potential implementations in browsers.

## Live demos

Demos are available at the following location:
https://jurca.github.io/dynamic-template/index.html

Some demos contain additional comments in the source code. Furthermore, there
are comments in the polyfill itself elaborating on the intended behavior of a
full-featured implementation.
